Between 1500 and 2000 time units, the value of signal RWs_angular_momentum shall be less than 0.35.
Spd_Tgt is always in the range [0, 1000].
V_Sply is always in the range [10, 14].
If the value of signal not_Eclipse is equal to 0, then the value of signal sun_currents shall be equal to 0.
If the value of signal RWs_angular_momentum is greater than 0.35, then the value of signal RWs_torque shall be equal to 0.
If the value of signal currentADCSMode is equal to NMC, then the value of signal control_error shall be greater than or equal to 10.
If the value of signal control_error is less than 10, then the value of signal currentADCSMode shall be equal to NMF.
If the value of signal currentADCSMode is equal to NMF, then the value of signal control_error shall be less than or equal to 15.
If the value of signal not_Eclipse is equal to 1, then the value of signal sun_angle shall be less than 45.
Whenever Op_Cmd is set to Running then in response Op_Ind should be set to Green without any delay.
While V_Mot is 0, then all of the following conditions hold: Spd_Act is 0.
Whenever Op_Cmd changes to Passive then in response Spd_Act changes to 0 after at most 500 time units.
Whenever Op_Cmd changes to Running then in response Spd_Act should enter the range [0, 1000] at some moment after at most 500 time units.
Whenever V_Mot enters the range [1, 12] then in response starting after at most 100 time units Spd_Act must be in the range [100, 1000].

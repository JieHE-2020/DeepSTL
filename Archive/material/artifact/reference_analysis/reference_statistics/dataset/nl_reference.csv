The first requirement (26) specifies the maximum permitted overshoot or undershoot
The STL requirement (27) specifies that after each rising or falling edge of the pulse, the signal settles within Î· seconds, and remains within the settling region (that we define as Î»ref Â± 0.02Î»ref ) until the next rising or falling edge of the pulse can occur. (See Fig. 2(b) for an illustration of these requirements).
Thus, requirement (29) states that the RMS error at time T (i.e., the accumulated error over the duration (Ï„I , T )) is less than some value c.
Thus, this set of tolerances leads to the worst case behavior for the undershoot on Î¼, and requirement (30) specifies the worst-case permitted undershoot âˆ’cr .
Thus, this set of tolerances leads to the worst case overshoot on Î¼, and requirement (31) specifies the worst-case permitted overshoot cl.
As Î» in the power mode is regulated in an open-loop fashion and has a different set-point, we want to ensure that the controller is able to settle to a value close to Î»ref within a specified time after switching back from the power mode. The input profile pulse(a, Î¶ , d) for this requirement constrains a differently; the constraint used here is 8.8â—¦ â‰¤ a â‰¤ 90â—¦. This allows the controller to transition to the power mode and stay in that mode for approximately Î¶2 seconds. Requirement (32) characterizes this settling-time requirement.
We omit the requirement on settling time for brevity, and in (33) specify that the maximum undershoot/overshoot on Î» is within 20% of Î»pwr.
When the controller is in the startup or sensor_fail mode, the controller uses open-loop control. The requirements on Î» are similar in form to the ones in normal mode, but with relaxed bounds on the settling region and transient excursions (we omit the latter for brevity). The input profile pulse(a, Î¶ , d) has similar constraints on a as the one for requirements (26),(27).
Whenever we detect another vehicle in front of us, and this vehicle has been the preceding vehicle for at least T seconds, we expect the distance d to this vehicle to stay within a corridor of Îµ around the desired distance d_des.
Whenever we detect another vehicle in front of us, the distance d to this vehicle shall reach a corridor of Îµ around the desired distance ddes within T seconds and shall remain within this corridor.
Whenever the set speed vset is increased, the actual velocity v shall have passed 90 percent of the jump height Î”jump after vset T seconds, and analogously for decreases in set speed.
Whenever we detect another vehicle in front of us, we shall respect a velocity-dependent safe minimum distance d_safe(v) as long as the cut-in was far enough away to allow this.
The vehicle shall stay within the lane boundaries, if this is possible with the actuators it is equipped with.
For any desired rack position trajectory rdes(t) such that the desired rack position remains within +/âˆ’rmax and the desired rack speed vdes (t) remains within +/âˆ’vmax , the actual rack position r(t) shall remain within a corridor [rl(t),ru(t)] around the desired rack position rdes (t).
the motion performance property requires that agent i enter the goal region within Tf time steps
the safety property ensures that agent i shall never encounter obstacle regions
The above specification requires that, at all time steps, the cart displacement shouldnâ€™t exceed a magnitude of 0.1 and the angular displacement of the pole should not exceed a magnitude of 12â—¦.
We encode this specification using the following STL formula, which requires that the cart should eventually reach the top of the right side hill
The below specification is defined solely on the position of the end-effector, denoted (x, y, z), and the position of the goal (xg, yg, zg):

The absolute value of a continuous signal x is always less than 6
When the (Boolean) trigger rises, within 600 time units |x| has to drop below 1 and stay like that for at least 300 time units
whenever the vt signal crosses the threshold of 5, both vt and id have to remain continuously above 4.5 and 5 Â· 10âˆ’6 respectively, until id falls below 5e âˆ’ 6
wl is below 0.1 but will jump to above 3.8 within 15Î¼s and the cell is not in the programming mode (translated by the absolute value of the source current id being below 30 Â· 10âˆ’6). whenever not_pgm happens, the bitline signal bl should cross 3.8 before the end of the simulation, and remain above that threshold continuously until the word line wl goes above 6, which should happen within 300 and 1500Î¼s from the bl crossing.
whenever the programming procedure starts (translated by the crossing of 3.8 threshold by the bitline signal bf), bitline should not fall below that threshold until the signal vt becomes higher than 5 and the absolute value of the source current id goes below 5 Â· 10âˆ’6.
We first define the erasing condition that holds whenever the wordline signal wl is lower than âˆ’6 and p-well pw is above 5. whenever an erasing condition holds, the pointwise distance between the source s and p-well pw voltages has to be smaller than 0.1 and the value of pw should not be greater than 0.83 from the value of bitline bl.
whenever the bitline bl and word- line wl signals are above 2.5 threshold, the p-well signal pw has to be below âˆ’0.5
whenever DQS crosses the VIH(DC)min threshold from above,thepreviouscrossingofVIL(AC)max bythesignalDQ from above should precede it by at least a period of time of tDS.
1. we need to detect how much time these signals re-main in their falling slew region (between VREF(DC) and VIL(AC)max crossing VREF(DC) from above). This can be done with the following formula, which holds if the signal is in the falling slew region, as shown in Figure 24; 2.Hence, the falling slew rates of DQ and DQS are in the range between 1 and 2V /ns if the following formulas hold  3; Finally, the main property for the falling setup time, pro-vided that DQ and DQS falling slew rates are in the range between 1 and 2V /ns, is expressed as

5.3.1. Output lamping of inductive load - a. When switching OFF inductive loads with high side switches, the voltage VOUT drops below ground potential.
5.3.1. Output lamping of inductive load - b. To prevent the destruction of the device by avalanche due to high voltages, there is a voltage clamp mechanism ZDS(AZ) implemented that limits negative output voltage to a certain level (VS - VDS(AZ)). Please refer to Figure 10 and Figure 11 for details.
5.4. Inverse current capability - a. In case of inverse current, meaning a voltage VINV at the OUT put higher than the supply voltage VS, a current IINV will flow from output to VS pin via the body diode of the power transistor. 5.4. Inverse current capability - b. The output stage follows the state of the IN pin, except if the IN pin goes from OFF to ON during inverse.
5.4. Inverse current capability - c. In that particular case, the output stage is kept OFF until the inverse current disappears.
5.4. Inverse current capability - d. Nevertheless, (In that particular case), the current IINV should not be higher than IL(INV). Otherwise, the second channel can be corrupted and erratic behavior can be observed.
5.4. Inverse current capability - e. If the affected channel is OFF, the diagnostic will detect an open load at OFF.
5.4. Inverse current capability - e. If the affected channel is ON, the diagnostic will detect open load at ON (the overtemperature signal is inhibited).
6.1. Loss of ground protection - a. In case of loss of the module ground and the load remains connected to ground, the device protects itself by automatically turning OFF (when it was previously ON) or remains OFF.
6.1. Loss of ground protection - b. In case of loss of module or device ground, a current (IOUT(GND)) can flow out of the DMOS.
6.2. Undervoltage protection - a. If the supply voltage is between VS(UV) and VS(OP), the undervoltage mechanism is triggered.
6.2. Undervoltage protection - b. If the supply voltage is below the undervoltage mechanism VS(UV), the device is OFF (turns OFF).
6.2. Undervoltage protection - c. As soon as the supply voltage is above the undervoltage mechanism VS(OP), then the device can be switched ON.
6.2. Undervoltage protection - d. The diagnosis is not guaranteed until VS is in the VNOM range.
6.3. Overvoltage protection - a. In case of supply voltage higher than VS(AZ), the power transistor switches ON and the voltage across the logic section is clamped. As a result, the internal ground potential rises to VS - VS(AZ). Due to the ESD Zener diodes, the potential at pin INx, DSEL and DEN rises almost to that potential, depending on the impedance of the connected circuitry.
6.3. Overvoltage protection - b. In the case the device was ON, prior to overvoltage, the BTS5016-2EKA remains ON.
6.3. Overvoltage protection - c. In the case the BTS5016-2EKA was OFF, prior to overvoltage, the power transistor can be activated.
6.3. Overvoltage protection - d. In the case the supply voltage is in above VBAT(SC) and below VDS(AZ), the output transistor is still operational and follows the input.
6.4. Reverse Polarity Protection - In case of reverse polarity, the intrinsic body diodes of the power DMOS causes power dissipation. a. The current into the ground path and the logic pins has to be limited to the maximum current.
6.5.2Temperature Limitation in the Power DMOS - a. Each channel incorporates both an absolute (TJ(SC)) and a dynamic (TJ(SW)) temperature sensor.

The Î”TSTEP describes the deviceâ€™s warming, due to the overcurrent in the channel. c. A retry strategy is implemented such that when the DMOS temperature has cooled down enough, the switch is switched ON again, if the IN pin signal is still high (restart behavior).

This is the repository of our accepted paper in ICSE2022: DeepSTL - From English Requirements to Signal Temporal Logic.

1. Since this repository incorporates the trained model, in order to keep file integrity, we uploaded a .zip file instead of a folder.

*  Please download Archive.zip INDEPENDENTLY. Cloning this repository may not include the complete contents of this file. After extracting Archive.zip, please go to:

        /Archive/documents/README.pdf

   In this read-me document, We have provided very detailed guidance.

*  For quickly checking the results in the main paper, please refer to Section 4.1 in README.pdf. Nearly all results can be reproduced on different platforms. A detailed statement of reproducibility can be found in the introduction part of Section 4 of the read-me document.

*  We mentioned our experimental environment in Section 2. In this section, We also provided guidance on how to set up the environment from scratch.

2. We also uploaded our artifact to figshare, which includes a virtual machine with all environment set up. Please visit this link and ALWAYS download the latest version:
